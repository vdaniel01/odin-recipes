    <p>
      These sausage balls are as good as Bisquick® sausage balls, but without
      the carbs and gluten. They are also keto friendly! Eat them fresh out of
      the oven or refrigerate or freeze for later use.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound bulk spicy pork sausage</li>
      <li>1 pound shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons coconut flour</li>
      <li>(.25 ounce) packages unflavored gelatin</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a jelly roll pan
        with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine sausage, Cheddar cheese, almond flour, coconut flour, gelatin,
        egg, and baking powder in a large bowl. Mix to combine using your hands,
        a stand mixer, or a food processor. Form mixture into uniformly-sized
        balls (about 1 1/2-inch diameter) and place on the prepared pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, 23 to 28 minutes.
        Remove sausage balls and let cool on the pan until oil is reabsorbed,
        about 5 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
