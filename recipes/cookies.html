    <p>
      These chocolate thumbprint cookies have a ganache filling that bumps up
      the rich chocolate flavor and adds a nice creaminess to the cookie.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>¾ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>sanding sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>¼ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>2 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Position racks in the
        upper and lower thirds of oven. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment
        paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat butter and sugar at medium speed with an electric mixer until
        fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add egg and vanilla, beating until
        incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk together flour, cocoa, salt, and cinnamon in a medium bowl until
        combined. With mixer on low speed, gradually add flour mixture to butter
        mixture, beating until well combined, about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll dough into 1 1/4-inch balls, then roll balls in sanding sugar.
        Place on the prepared baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart. Press the
        center of each ball with your thumb (about 1/2-inch deep and 1/2-inch
        wide).
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in preheated oven in upper and lower thirds, 2 baking sheets at a
        time, rotating top to bottom and bottom to top halfway through, until
        cookies are set and almost firm, 8 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let cool on baking sheets, about 15 minutes. When cool, press the center
        of each ball with your thumb again—the indentations will have puffed in
        the oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat cream in a small microwavable bowl on HIGH until just steaming,
        about 45 seconds. Remove from the heat, and add chopped chocolate. Let
        the mixture sit, undisturbed, for 2 minutes. Stir until melted and
        smooth. Let cool until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Place about
        1 teaspoon filling in the center of each cookie. Slide the cookies into
        the refrigerator for about 10 minutes to set the filling. The cookies
        will keep for about 5 days in an airtight container at room temperature.
